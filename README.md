### Data acquisition and cleaning

Data acquired in different ways; 
* Direct download of a csv file.
* Programmatically download a tsv file from Udacity's servers using Python's requests library.
* Using the [tweepy](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/) library to access Twitter's API and download tweet info.

After acquiring the data, assess and clean it in a jupyter notebook using Python pandas and other modules.
