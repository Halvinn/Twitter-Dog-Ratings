In this project, I prcatice data wrangling and cleaning. 

Data acquired in different ways; 
* Direct download of a csv file.
* Programmatically download a tsv file from Udacity's servers using Python's requests library.
* Using the tweeyp module to download tweet information from a user's twitter profile.

After acquiring the data, I cleaned it in a jupyter notebook using Python pandas and other modules.

Finally use a few visualizations to comminucate any interesting findings about the data.
